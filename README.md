Radio boxes, Check Boxes, And List Boxes


For this assignment, I was tasked with creating a program that utilizes List boxes, radio buttons, and check boxes. The program could be anything as long as these three things are used. My typical go-to is to make something game like, so I created a limited character creation form. 

For Radio Buttons, I created three options to choose from, and put them under a group box that prompts the user to pick a range. It ranges from low to high, and based on which is selected, the user's "character" is given a random amount of mana within the range selected. This is accompanied by a message box letting you know which button you pressed along with a label outputting the results with unquie message for each choice.


I used check boxes in a very similar manner to Radio Boxes. Instead of a range, the check boxes determines what Character Class you are. Like radio boxes I gave three options, Wizard, Knight, and Paladin. Each has their own message box notification and line of text depending on which you select. Since check boxes can take more than one answer, I accounted for a situation if more than one answer is selected. If two or all of the options are selected, the user will get a notification that they have "selected too many options" and will ask for them to pick again.


Finally, for list boxes, I handled this one a tad bit differently. Since this one works like a drop down, I simply used it to hold the skills a user can choose from. It is at the end of the text created by the options picked with radio buttons and check boxes.


I have included screenshots of the code and the program running with multiple test runs.
